# ZoomLinkKeeper
This is a project for my iOS Programming class. 
This is an app that keeps the Zoom links and automatically displays the links of the current period and the next period for SJP students.
To use it, just copy the Zoom URLs from various pages on Canvas and paste them into their corresponding blocks,
and then go to Today View (or Widgets if you're using iOS >14), and enable the widget.
